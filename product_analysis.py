    ### ðŸŸ¢ China
    - Strong **positive trade balances** in:
      - HS 39: Plastics
      - HS 84 & 85: Machinery & Electrical equipment
      - HS 87: Vehicles
    - **Negative trade balance** in:
      - HS 12 (agriculture): Heavy importer

    ### ðŸ”µ United States
    - **Positive trade balances** in:
      - HS 12: Agriculture (strong exporter)
    - **Mixed or negative balances** in:
      - HS 39, 84, 85, 87: Indicates reliance on imports
      - HS 90 & 94: Competitive but fluctuating

    ---

    ### âœ… Final Conclusion:
    - **China dominates in manufacturing-related exports** (machinery, electronics, vehicles).
    - **US leads in agriculture**, but is **less competitive** in manufactured goods.
    - Trade imbalances align with each countryâ€™s **industrial strengths and dependencies**.
